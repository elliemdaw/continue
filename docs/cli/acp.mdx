sidebarTitle: "ACP (Zed)"
---

Continue CLI can run as an Agent Client Protocol (ACP) server over stdio. This lets editors like Zed connect directly to Continue for streaming responses and tool execution.

<Info>
  The ACP server enables seamless integration between Continue's powerful AI capabilities and ACP-compatible editors through a standardized protocol.
</Info>

## Requirements

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    Ensure `cn` is on your PATH. See the [installation guide](/cli/install) for details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Continue">
    Set up a valid Continue configuration with at least one model. See [configuration docs](/setup/configuration) for details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable External Agents in Zed">
    Make sure your Zed editor has External Agents enabled.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure Zed

Add an external agent entry to `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

<CodeGroup>
```json Basic Setup
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Continue": {
      "command": "cn",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json Read-only Mode
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Continue (Read-only)": {
      "command": "cn",
      "args": ["acp", "--readonly"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json Custom Config
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Continue (Custom Config)": {
      "command": "cn",
      "args": ["acp", "--config", "/path/to/config.yaml"]
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Configuration Options">
  - **Basic Setup**: Auto-approves tool access for full functionality
  - **Read-only Mode**: Uses `--readonly` flag to restrict write operations
  - **Custom Config**: Uses `--config` flag to specify an alternate configuration file path
</Accordion>

## Using Continue in Zed

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Workspace">
    Launch Zed and open your project workspace.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access the AI Panel">
    Open the AI panel in Zed and select the Continue agent from the available agents.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Chatting">
    Send prompts as you normally would. Continue will stream responses via ACP and execute tools as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  **Tool Permissions**: ACP mode defaults to auto-approve tool access. For safer operation, use the `--readonly` flag to restrict write operations.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Supported ACP Methods**: The server currently supports:
  - `session/new` - Create new chat sessions
  - `session/prompt` - Send prompts and receive responses
  - `session/cancel` - Cancel in-progress requests
  - `session/set_mode` - Switch between tool permission modes
  
  Session loading functionality is not yet available.
</Note>

<Info>
  **MCP Server Configuration**: MCP servers provided by the ACP client are ignored. Configure all MCP servers in your Continue configuration instead.
